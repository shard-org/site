labels are defined as a pointer to wherever they're placed in the final binary.<br>
All statics, constants, functions, loops, etc are essentially labels.<br><br>

They begin with an identifier and end with <c>:</c><br>
eg: <c>main:</c><br><br>

Labels may also be anonymous, meaning they dont require to have a specific name. <br>
This can be used for a simple way to optain loops, match statements, or conditionals. <br><br>

if the label ends with the <c>()</c> or <c>{}</c> attribute, the leading <c>:</c> may be ommited. <br>


<h2>Calls and Returns</h2>
   Calling an address pushes the current IP to the stack,<br>
   later whenever returning a word is popped from the stack and IP set to the value <br><br>

   use the <c>!</c> symbol to call an adress and the <c>ret</c> keyword to return, possibly with a value.<br>
   eg: <c>!print_hello</c>, <c>!0xdeadbeef</c><br>
   eg: <c>ret</c>, <c>ret 20</c><br><br>

   You may also jump directly to an adress using the <c>jmp</c> instruction. <br>
   This however, does not allow you to return to the point you jumped from. <br>
   eg: <c>jmp some_func</c>, <c>jmp 0xdeadbeef</c><br>


<h2>Attributes</h2>
   These are inserted after the identifier of a function/label. <br>

   eg: <c>main entry:</c> <i>entry</i> here is an attribute. <br><br>

   Attributes should also be separated by a comma.<br>
     
   <div class="block quote">
      <b>entry</b><br>
      The program's entry point. Exclusive to one label.
   </div>

   <div class="block quote">
      <b>{}</b> - body<br>
      A scope containing any number of statemenets.
   </div>

   <div class="block quote">
      <b>@</b> - at<br>
      Takes the next value. If its a literal use as the address of that label,<br>
      if value starts with <c>.</c> treat it as a binary section, like <c>.rodata</c><br>
      eg: <c>STATIC_VAR @ .data [1]: "Hello, World!"</c>
   </div>
   
   <div class="block quote">
      <b>()</b> - condition<br>
      Run label if condition is met, otherwise ignore. <br>
      The condition is pre-checked for jumps, as it's impossible to figure out where to return after one. <br>
      eg: <c>(var = 20) $puts "var is 20"</c>
   </div>
   
   <div class="block quote">
      <b>loop</b><br>
      Requires <i>body</i>. <br>
      Jump to itself at the end of scope.<br>
      Optionally may have a block after it, which will run after every iteration of the loop<br>
<code><pre>
%i 8
loop {'i ++}:
   $printf "%d", i
</pre></code>
   </div>

   <div class="block quote">
      <b>def</b><br>
      Defines a following expr as an anonymous macro <c>#</c>. <br>
      eg:<br>
<code><pre>
do_thing def 20 {  
    $printf "%d", #
}                  
</pre></code>
   </div>

   <div class="block quote">
      <b>||</b><br>
      Requires <i>body</i>. <br>
      Applies all attributes between the <c>||</c> to all labels in the following scope. <br>
      eg:<br>
<code><pre>
|@ .rodata| {       
    CONST1: 8       
    CONST2: 97      
    CONST3: "Hi Mom"
}                   
</pre></code>
   </div>

   <div class="block quote">
      <b>asm</b><br>
      Requires <i>body</i>. <br>
      <s>We're actually debating this as it's a label block with custom syntax</s>
      Raw assembly, pasted into the generated output.<br>
      eg:<br>
<code><pre>
asm {
   mov $0, %rax
}
</pre></code>
   </div>

   <div class="block quote">
      <b>=&gt;</b> - then<br>
      Requires <i>body</i>. <br>
      Expects a following body.<br>
      Executes the following block after the current function returns.<br>
      eg: <br>
<code><pre>
%i 4                     
loop {'i ++}, (i &lt; 10), =&gt; {$puts "done!"}:
    $printf "%d", i      
</pre></code>
   </div>

   <div class="block quote">
      <b>init</b><br>
      Requires <i>body</i>. <br>
      Expects a following body.<br>
      Executes the following block upon func call.<br>
      The block is not included within <i>loop</i> iterations,<br>
      making it useful for setting init values and variables.<br>
      eg: <br>
<code><pre>
loop {'i ++}, (i &lt; 10), init {%i 4}:
    $printf "%d", i      
</pre></code>
   </div>

   <div class="block quote">
      <b>arg</b><br>
      Make the label require an argument of that type when called. <br>
      The argument will then be assigned to an identifier, by default stack allocated,<br>
      if the type is a register instead register allocated. <br>
      eg: <c>TYPE IDENT</c>, <c>add 4 a, 4 b:</c>
   </div>

   <div class="block quote">
      <b>-&gt;</b> - return<br>
      Mark the label as returning a value of TYPE.
      Allowing `ret` to accept an argument. <br>
      eg: <c>-&gt; TYPE</c>, <c>ten -&gt; 1: ret 10</c>
   </div>

   The argument and return types act more as hints and convenience attributes<br>
   to the compiler and user, rather than as concerete rules. <br>
   It is possible to return values from a function that doesnt <i>state</i> it returns them,<br>
   or jump to a label with arguments it never intended to have. <br><br>

   This shows up as a compiler warning, as it's unstable and potentially the source of many bugs. <br>
   However as all compiler warnings it can be disabled


<h2>Lambdas</h2>
A supertype of an anonymous label.<br>
These can contain only a single statement, which is automatically returned.<br>
eg: <br>
<code><pre>
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
   =&gt; !map |x: x * x|
   =&gt; !for_each |x: $printf "%d", x|
</pre></code>
