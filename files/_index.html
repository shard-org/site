      <b style="font-size:1.2em">Shard</b> - "The OSR of programming languages"

      <h2>Premise</h2>
      <p>Flexible, assembly-adjacent language geared towards compile target flexibility, ease of use, and direct control.</p>
      <p>No implicit assumptions, everything must be explicitly declared.</p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <div class=block>
         <p>- Fine grained low level access to hardware features, like registers, syscalls, and interrupts.</p>
         <p>- No <i>"Safety Features"</i> preventing you from doing what you want. Nor stupid stuff. (not mutually exclusive)</p>
         <p>- Terse, yet <s>probably</s> clear and concise syntax.</p>
         <p>- Architecture details are defined within the standard library, meaning adding support for additional ones doesn't
              require modifying any compiler source code, and can by done by the user. As long as there's a compatible assembler, of course.</p>
         <p>- Shark mascot! Which <i>someone</i> (not pointing fingers, however their name might begin with "j" and end with "esse") hasn't drawn yet :/
      </div>

      <h2>Non-Features</h2>
      <div class=block>
         <p>- Shard is neither meant to be cross-platform, nor an IR. All architectures are inherently dissimilar,
         reconsiling them into one cannot be done without compromises </p>
         <p>- Planned optimization level is low if not none. If you want to write crazy fast code go use one of these instead: 
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/gnu-c-manual.html">C</a>,
            <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>,
            <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>
         </p>
         <p>- Standard library is only for defining the architecture, and writing base wrappers and helpers. You wont find anything over the <i>bare minimum</i>
            Use <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">libc</a> if you want an expansive standard library.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Novelties</h2>
      <div class=block>
         <p>- Type Casting Operators: What began as <b>Shard</b>'s answer to float and signed math, has now become one of the core concepts of the type system. 
              This now allows for behaviours similar to <i>methods</i> and <i>generic types</i> in other languages, with practically none of the heavy lifting!</p>
         <p>- Self Contained Projects: No need for 20 separate files with layers of build scripts and manifest files.
              <b>Shard</b> files can contain build scripts, project definitions, packaging/version info on their own through the <i>Tag</i> system!</p>
